### Main goals
The apllication was created to present my skills in programming and pulling data from API. This project was coded with JavaScript and the entire data comes from the open source REST API.

### What this app can do?

The application provide the current weather information in all the cites of the world. Type any city name in the input field and press enter or click Search button to check the weather in this city.

### Implementations

This app is written in JavaScript and pulls data using Axios library. The sunrise and sunset time pulled from API is coverted from Unix Epoch value to standars time format. Some data form API are converted to values that meet the standards, for expample temperature is rounded to whole numbers. There was Prettier and ESLint used to prevent bugs and keep well-structured code. The dashboard was designed and coded by myself in CSS/SCSS.
