## Weather App
Follow this link to see the project: https://weather-app-netlify-js.netlify.app/

### Main goals
The application was created to showcase my programming skills and data retrieval from APIs. This project was coded with JavaScript, and all the data comes from the open-source REST API.

### What this app can do?

The application provides current weather information for all the cities of the world. Type any city name in the input field and press enter or click the Search button to check the weather in this city.

### Implementations

This app is written in JavaScript and pulls data using the Axios library. The sunrise and sunset time pulled from the API are converted from Unix Epoch value to standard time format. Some data from the API is converted to values that meet the standards; for example, temperature is rounded to whole numbers. Prettier and ESLint were used to prevent bugs and maintain well-structured code. The dashboard was designed and coded by myself in CSS/SCSS.

The entire weather data in this app comes from OpenWeather API.
